# p5.js Playground

A dumping hodgepodge of my random coding project I do for practice!

### Heads up

These are largely made for fun and consequently may not possess the soundest quality.

**I will also do no maintenance whatsoever!**

## How do I use this?

For now, you can clone the repo, or simply download by clicking to **Code** > **Download ZIP**, and open the `index.html` in a directory to run a project, and `sketch.js` to view the code. [Everything's modifiable too](LICENSE).

The Github Pages deployment would be coming soon.

## Interesting ones
| Link      | Devlog     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Blow 'Till Pop](blow-til-pop/) | An endless game where you blow bubbles and avoid bursting them. Simple on surface, but quite interesting to code, probably the most fun I've had coding with Geometry. |
| [Bouncing Ball](bouncing-ball/) | I coded this as a simple and sweet visual, inspired by Windows' solitare win screen. |
| [Circlepong](circlepong/) | This is a highly primitive game I coded inspired by Pong. |
| [Flappy Circle (WIP)](flappy-circle/) | A game inspired by [Don't Touch The Spikes](https://youtu.be/7t3qfK6mP64). Though I initially coded it an a flappy bird clone, but I thought this direction would be more interesting to develop |
| [Houses for Sale (WIP)](house-for-sale/) | Randomly generated houses. |
| [Snake (WIP)](snake/) | The snake's tail and collision were a bit tricky though, I decided it to keep it as a work in progress for the time being. It was fun making this. |
| [Legacy](legacy/) | Contains my older coding projects. |
